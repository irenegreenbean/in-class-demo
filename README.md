# social-attribute-rating-mandarin-accents
This is my experiment repo for 245b!

This study is a partial replication of previous work investigating language attitudes towards different accents of Mandarin. Previous research (Cavallaro et al. 2018; Chong & Tan 2013; a.o.) have used matched guise and verbal guise experiments to probe at Singaporean listeners’ social evaluations of different Mandarin accents, such as Chinese Mandarin, Taiwanese Mandarin, and Singaporean Mandarin. These studies separated attributes into “Status” and “Solidarity” traits in their analyses. Thus, the present study is part of a broader project of investigating Singaporean listeners’, Chinese listeners’, and Taiwanese listeners’ social attribute ratings of different accents of Mandarin. However, in this paper, only results from Singaporean listeners will be presented and discussed, making it more directly in conversation with predictions from previous literature.

In this study, a social attribute rating task was carried out in the form of a web-based experiment. Critical trials included clips of Singaporean Mandarin, Beijing Mandarin, Taiwanese Mandarin, and Standard (Chinese) Mandarin in clips of recorded speech (from a reading passage). Filler trials included clips of other Mandarin accents reading those same sentences. The purpose of this experiment was to replicate findings from previous literature on Singaporeans (Cavallaro et al. 2018; Chong & Tan 2013). Additionally, the present experiment used both Beijing Mandarin and Standard Mandarin, which are distinct from one another but often treated as the same (Chinese) variety in perception studies (or the use of one or the other is ambiguous as to which is being represented). The purpose of including these as distinct accents was to help tease apart the social attribute ratings for Beijing Mandarin and Standard Mandarin.
